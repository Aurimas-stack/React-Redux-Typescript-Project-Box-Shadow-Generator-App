Project done using React Hooks, Redux for state management and Typescript.

Main idea of the project: using visual representation get needed output for CSS box-shadow.

- User can see input sliders for these values : 1) Right Shift 2) Bottom Shift 3) Blur 4) Spread 5) Border radius 6) Element width and height.
- Sliders on page load are pre-selected.
- Sliders have maximum and minimum values.
- Sliders display pixel values to the side.
- User can see inset button for setting shadow inset, he can unset the shadow by pressing the same button.
- User can reset options, and copy the needed CSS to clipboard by pressing buttons.
- User can see output of the CSS options which he can manually copy.
- User can choose colour by using input type="color". Colour is displayed next to the picker and, in the general output.
- User can see element ("box") and the element's shadow.
